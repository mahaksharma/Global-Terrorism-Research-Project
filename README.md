# Global-Terrorism-Research-Project

The work enlightens the urgent need to eradicate the terrorism and work upon the field of terrorism. It describes the features and factors affecting the attacks and their involvement for future event prediction. Various methods for predicting the attacker groups, their correlation with the weapon used, their relation with prediction of success for an attack and the effect due to changes in weather conditions has been proposed through various classification and modelling techniques. The implementation of Random Forest, LR, NB, Decision Tree, K-Means Clustering and the self developed dummy classifier has shown the improvement with respect to the previous works of researchers. Since the terrorism in on the rise, it focuses and opens up the wide field for the researchers to work on with the big data and hence terminate the terrorism by their prior
predictions.
